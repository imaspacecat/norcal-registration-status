# FTC Team Status Scraper

## Overview
This Python script leverages web scraping to gather team registration status data from the [NorCal FTC website](https://www.norcalftc.org/). The collected information is then formatted and exported into a CSV file for easy analysis and reference.

## Dependencies
- [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have installed the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python team_status_scraper.py
    ```

## Output
The script generates a CSV file (`team_status.csv`) containing team registration status information. The CSV file includes details such as the team number, QT #1, QT #2, QT #3, etc.
